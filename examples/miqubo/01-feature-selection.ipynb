    "# What is Feature Selection?\n",
    "Statistical and machine-learning models use a set of input variables (features)\n",
    "to predict output variables of interest. Feature selection, which can be\n",
    "part of the model design process, simplifies the model and reduces dimensionality by selecting,\n",
    "from a given set of potential features, a subset of highly informative ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Farmer Jones were creating a model for predicting the ripening of her hothouse tomatoes, she might start recording daily the following list of potential features: date, air temperature, degree of cloudiness, hours of daylight, daily water, fertilizer, air humidity, hours of electric light, ambient music style. After a growth season or two, she analyzes correlations between these features and her tomato crops. Her analysis reveals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* date, cloudiness, daylight have little predictive power\n",
    "* water and humidity are highly predictive of crop rot; they are also highly correlated (the hothouse has a roof sprinkler) \n",
    "* fertilizer is highly predictive of fruit size\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmer Jones understands that her hothouse's electric light makes her crop less dependant on seasons (date) and sunshine (cloudiness). She can simplify her model by disregarding those features. She can also reduce the number of inputs by recording either her water or humidity measurement but not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "For systems with large amounts of potential input information, such as weather forecasting or facial recognition, the model complexity and required compute resources can be daunting. Feature selection can help make such models tractable. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, optimal feature selection itself can be a hard problem. This example introduces a powerful method of optimizing feature selection based on a hard probability calculation. To overcome the difficulties of this calculation, it formulates a solution by quantum computer.  "

If this was a model of Farmer Jones's tomatoes, selecting water and fertilizer should be better than water and humidity.\n",
